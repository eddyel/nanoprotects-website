**Design Movement**: Moroccan Modernism with Immersive Overlay

**Core Principles**:
- Atmospheric depth through layered imagery and dark overlays creating emotional resonance
- Material authenticity showcasing bejmat, carreaux de ciment, pierre de Taza, and marble as hero elements
- Dual-service clarity through visual storytelling (cleaning → protection transformation)
- Heritage preservation meets cutting-edge science through juxtaposition of traditional craftsmanship and molecular visualization

**Color Philosophy**: Deep charcoal overlays (#2D2D2D with 60-70% opacity) unify diverse material backgrounds while allowing their natural warmth to glow through. Vibrant blue (#0066CC) serves as the technology accent, creating contrast against warm terracotta, gold, and beige tones of Moroccan materials. White text floats ethereally over dark atmospheres, ensuring readability while maintaining premium feel.

**Layout Paradigm**: Full-bleed immersive sections with edge-to-edge imagery. Each section is a self-contained visual story with its own material background. Content floats in semi-transparent cards or directly over imagery with strategic overlays. Asymmetric text placement favors left-third positioning to create breathing room and avoid centered monotony.

**Signature Elements**:
- Triptych transformation sequences showing dirty → clean → protected states
- Phase badges (large numbered circles) with distinct iconography for cleaning vs. protection
- Material close-ups as backgrounds creating tactile connection to surfaces being protected
- Certification badges in metallic gold/blue reinforcing trust and scientific rigor

**Interaction Philosophy**: Smooth scroll-triggered parallax effects on background images create depth. Hover states on cards lift them slightly with subtle shadow increase. Language switcher uses flag icons with smooth fade transitions. CTA buttons have gentle pulse animation drawing attention without distraction.

**Animation**: Entrance animations use fade-up with stagger delays (100ms between elements). Scroll-triggered reveals for benefit cards and process steps. Background images have subtle ken burns effect (slow zoom) creating living atmosphere. Transition between sections uses gradient dissolve maintaining visual continuity.

**Typography System**: 
- Display: Playfair Display (serif) for headlines - elegant, timeless, connects to heritage
- Body: Inter (sans-serif) for readability and modern professionalism
- Hierarchy: H1 at 3.5rem/4rem (mobile/desktop), H2 at 2.5rem/3rem, body at 1.125rem
- Weight contrast: Display uses 600-700 weight, body uses 400-500, creating clear visual separation

**Design Movement**: Brutalist Luxury with Material Honesty

**Core Principles**:
- Raw material beauty without excessive ornamentation
- Bold typography as structural element, not decoration
- Grid-based asymmetry creating tension and interest
- Monochromatic base with material colors as only accent

**Color Philosophy**: Near-black backgrounds (#1A1A1A) create gallery-like atmosphere where materials become art pieces. No blue accent - instead, natural material colors (terracotta, cream, grey veining) provide all chromatic interest. Text is pure white or warm off-white (#F5F5F0) for maximum contrast and legibility.

**Layout Paradigm**: Broken grid system where sections deliberately misalign, creating visual rhythm through disruption. Large negative space treated as active design element. Text blocks positioned in unexpected locations (top-right, bottom-left) forcing eye movement across canvas.

**Signature Elements**:
- Oversized typography bleeding off edges
- Material samples presented as framed specimens with thin white borders
- Before/after sliders with industrial-style drag handles
- Minimal line-art icons in white stroke, no fills

**Interaction Philosophy**: Interactions are deliberate and weighty. Buttons have no hover state - clicking produces immediate, confident action. Scrolling is smooth but not eased, maintaining sense of control. Language switcher is text-only, no flags, emphasizing linguistic precision.

**Animation**: Minimal animation philosophy - only functional motion. Page transitions are instant cuts, no fades. Elements appear in place, no entrance animations. Only animation is before/after slider drag which moves with 1:1 finger tracking for tactile feedback.

**Typography System**:
- Display: Space Grotesk (geometric sans) for headlines - bold, architectural, modern
- Body: IBM Plex Mono (monospace) for body text - technical, precise, unexpected
- Hierarchy: H1 at 4rem/6rem (mobile/desktop), H2 at 2rem/3.5rem, body at 1rem
- Weight: Single weight (700) for all headlines, 400 for all body, creating stark binary

**Design Movement**: Cinematic Storytelling with Gradient Transitions

**Core Principles**:
- Website as film experience with chapters (Why, What, How)
- Gradual tonal shift from dark contemplation to bright revelation
- Motion as narrative device guiding user through transformation journey
- Emotional arc built through color temperature progression

**Color Philosophy**: Journey begins in warm darkness (deep browns #3E2723, amber #FFA000) evoking traditional riad atmosphere. Middle section transitions to cool neutrals (slate grey #475569) representing the liminal space of transformation. Final section arrives at bright clarity (white #FFFFFF with cool blue accents #0EA5E9) symbolizing protected future. Gradient overlays blend between sections creating seamless narrative flow.

**Layout Paradigm**: Cinematic 16:9 aspect ratio sections with letterbox framing on ultra-wide screens. Content follows rule of thirds composition. Diagonal cuts between sections using CSS clip-path create dynamic transitions mimicking film editing techniques.

**Signature Elements**:
- Diagonal section dividers with SVG wave patterns
- Progress indicator showing user's position in narrative (dots or timeline)
- Testimonial quotes presented as film subtitles with fade-in timing
- Material textures with film grain overlay for tactile warmth

**Interaction Philosophy**: Scroll-jacking creates controlled cinematic pacing - each section snaps into view like film scene. Horizontal card carousels for case studies mimic film strip. Hover reveals additional information through venetian blind wipe effect.

**Animation**: Heavy use of scroll-triggered animations. Parallax backgrounds move at 0.5x speed creating depth. Text reveals use typewriter effect for headlines. Before/after transformations auto-play on scroll into view with smooth crossfade (2s duration). Scene transitions use gradient wipes.

**Typography System**:
- Display: Cormorant Garamond (serif) for headlines - cinematic, elegant, literary
- Body: Source Sans Pro (humanist sans) for warmth and readability
- Hierarchy: H1 at 3rem/5rem (mobile/desktop), H2 at 2rem/3rem, body at 1.125rem
- Weight progression: Headlines start at 300 (light) in dark sections, increase to 600 (semibold) in bright sections, mirroring tonal journey
